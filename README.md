## NCode Notebooks
There are a wide range of notebooks including pocket sized books, A4-sized paper pads, and stylish journals. Every notebook features NCodeTM technology that allows users to share their notes via email, directly from the page. Neo smartpen requires Ncoded notebooks. Ncodes are printed on every paper of N notebooks and provides signals that enable The Neo smartpen to trace handwriting.

## About Ncode™: service development guide
‘Natural Handwriting’ technology based on Ncode™(Microscopic data patterns containing various types of data) is a handwriting stroke recovery technology that digitizes paper coordinates obtained by optical pen devices such as Neo smartpen. The coordinates then can be used to store handwriting stroke information, analyzed to extract meaning based on user preferences and serve as the basis for many other types of services.
